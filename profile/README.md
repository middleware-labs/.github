## Observability Space

[Middleware](https://middleware.io) is an AI-powered full-stack observability platform designed to boost operational efficiency, minimize downtime, and enhance user experience.
We’re building a scalable, cloud-native tool to help developers debug and monitor systems with speed and precision.
It helps developers and operations teams gain comprehensive insights into their infrastructure and application performance, empowering them to resolve any issues before they impact end-users.


## Latest Launch
